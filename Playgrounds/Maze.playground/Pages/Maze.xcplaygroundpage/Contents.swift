## A Couple New Helper Instructions

SwiftBot knows all its normal commands in addition to two more:

- `canGoLeft()` which indicates if there's open space to the left of the robot
- `canGoRight()` which indicates if there's open space to the right of the robot

*/

setup(0)

/* Uncomment this next line of code to see a trail of smoke
 * left behind by the robot. Useful for seeing where
 * your robot has been so far!
 */

// enableSmokeTrails()



/*
 * You can change the '50' to a number between 0 and 100
 * to change the speed of the robot. 0 is slowest, and
 * 100 is fastest.
 */

setSpeed(25)
