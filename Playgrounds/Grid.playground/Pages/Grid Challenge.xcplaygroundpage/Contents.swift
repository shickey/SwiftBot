# A Challenge Problem!

Swift starts in the lower right corner of a large square map:

![Start](square_start.png)

Write instructions for SwiftBot to fill the square with an alternating pattern of cookies, beginning with a cookie in the lower right corner:

![Goal](square_goal.png)

## Some things to consider:

- There is more than 1 way to complete this map!
- It doesn't matter where SwiftBot ends up
- Sometimes SwiftBot will need to turn left, but sometimes SwiftBot will need to turn right. Consider writing a custom turnRight() function to help!
- What pattern(s) do we notice in this challenge? How might we break down the steps into custom SwiftBot commands that we can use over and over again?

## In case it's helpful...
...the syntax to define a new command is

    func newCommandName() {
        
    }

where `newCommandName` is whatever you want to call your new command. This should be defined _before_ the instructions block so that you can use your command inside the instructions block.
