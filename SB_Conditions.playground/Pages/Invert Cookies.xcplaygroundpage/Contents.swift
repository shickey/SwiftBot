# Inverting Cookies

This map is similar to the previous one in that SwiftBot starts in a hallway with a random number of cookies.

## Your Goal
The goal for this map is to get SwiftBot to **invert the cookies**. I.e., SwiftBot should pick up a cookie on any square that has one and leave a cookie on any square that doesn't have one.

## The `if/else` Statement
As we saw in the previous level, we can use an `if` statement to run code only when a condition is true. But what if we want to run different code when that condition is false? The `if/else` statement allows us to do exactly that. For example:

    if senseCookie() {
        // This code will run if SwiftBot is
        // standing on a cookie
    }
    else {
        // This code will run if SwiftBot is
        // NOT standing on a cookie
    }
