 # SwiftBot!
 
 Welcome to SwiftBot! SwiftBot is a little orange robot that likes cookies and exploration. SwiftBot looks like this:

 SwiftBot lives in a 2D room with blue walls. Open floor space is white in SwiftBot's world.

 Each square on the floor can also contain a cookie. A cookie looks like a red circle in SwiftBot's world.

 ## Setup

Over on the right, you should see SwiftBot standing in a hallway. In a moment, we'll write some instructions to move SwiftBot to the other end of the hallway. But first, we're going to need some setup.

 **YOU CAN IGNORE THIS LINE OF CODE (but don't delete it!)**

 Phew. Now that that's out of the way, let's get SwiftBot to do stuff.
 
 ## Your Goal
 Your goal is to get SwiftBot to place a cookie at the end of the hallway. When finished, your map should look like this:

 ## SwiftBot Commands
 SwiftBot knows very few commands. Here are 2 of them:
 
 ### `goForward()`
 The `goForward()` command will make SwiftBot move forward one space in the direction they're currently facing
 
 ### `placeCookie()`
 The `placeCookie()` command will make SwiftBot drop a cookie on the space they're currently standing on. But be careful! Placing a cookie on a square that already has one will create an UNSTABLE COOKIE STACK which is an error.
 
 ## Programming SwiftBot
  Let's write some instructions for SwiftBot. All instructions go inside the `instructions` block. Here's an example that will make SwiftBot move forward one space, drop a cookie, then move forward two spaces:

    instructions = {

        goForward()
        placeCookie()
        goForward()
        goForward()

    }
 */

instructions = {
    
    // Write your instructions for SwiftBot below these lines 
    // (and before the `}` curly bracket)!
    //
    // Try writing goForward()
    // Then save, and see what happens.
    // Note that the parentheses are necessary!
    // 
    // Once that works, write the rest of the instructions (one per line)
    // to get SwiftBot to move to the end of the hallway
    // and drop a cookie
    //
    // WRITE INSTRUCTIONS HERE:
    
    
    
    
    
    
} // Be careful not to delete this } curly bracket!
