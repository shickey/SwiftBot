 # Turning Left
 SwiftBot can also turn, but being the simple robot they are, they can only turn left. To tell SwiftBot to turn left, use the command:
 
 ### `turnLeft()`
 This is cause SwiftBot to turn left in place (i.e., they will stay on their current square)
 
 ## Your Goal
 Similar to before, tell SwiftBot to move to the end of the hallway and place a cookie there:
 
 ![Turn Left and Drop a Cookie](turnleft_goal.png)
